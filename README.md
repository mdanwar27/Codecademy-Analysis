**📊 Codecademy Student Enrollment Analysis**

**📌 Project Overview :**

This project analyzes Codecademy student enrollment, course popularity, trends and difficulty levels. Using data from the Codecademy official website, we aim to uncover key insights about learning patterns and course effectiveness.

**🔍 Key Objectives :**

1. Analyze student enrollment across different courses.
2. Identify popular courses and emerging learning trends.
3. Examine difficulty levels and their impact on completion rates.
4. Detect patterns in student engagement over time.
5. Provide data-driven insights for course improvements.

**📂 Data Source :**

The data for this analysis was sourced from the official Codecademy website, through web scraping.

You can download the Scrapped Jupyter Notebook File directly from the https://github.com/mdanwar27/Codecademy-Analysis/releases/download/notebook-v1/Scrapping_Codecademy-Final.ipynb

**🔧 Installation & Usage Instructions :**

To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, follow these steps:

**1️⃣ Install Python and Jupyter Notebook**

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, download it from Python.org. Then, install Jupyter Notebook using:

'''md
'''sh

pip install jupyterlab

**2️⃣ Install Required Libraries**

Use the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

**3️⃣ Clone the Repository**

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/codecademy-analysis.git
cd codecademy-analysis

**4️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook**

Start Jupyter Notebook and open the .ipynb file:

jupyter notebook

Then navigate to the Codecademy Analysis.ipynb file and run the code cells.

**💡 Suggestions & Improvements :**

1. Apply sentiment analysis on student reviews.

2. Compare Codecademy's courses with competitors like Coursera, Udemy, and edX for benchmarking.

3. Explore how gamification (badges, leaderboards) impacts student engagement.

**🚧 Challenges :**

❌ Missing Data – Some courses lacked sufficient enrollment or rating data.

❌ Bias in Reviews – Ratings may not always reflect course quality accurately due to limited feedback.
